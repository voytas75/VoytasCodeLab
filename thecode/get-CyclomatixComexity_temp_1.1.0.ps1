    .SYNOPSIS
        Calculates the cyclomatic complexity of a PowerShell script or code block, including both functions and top-level code.
    .DESCRIPTION
        This function analyzes the provided PowerShell script file or code block to calculate the cyclomatic complexity of each function defined within it, as well as the complexity of any code outside functions.
        The cyclomatic complexity score is interpreted as follows:
        1: The code has a single execution path with no control flow statements (e.g., if, else, while, etc.). This typically means the code is simple and straightforward.
        2 or 3: Code with moderate complexity, having a few conditional paths or loops.
        4-7: More complex code, with multiple decision points and/or nested control structures.
        Above 7: Indicates higher complexity, which can make the code harder to test and maintain.
    .PARAMETER FilePath
        The path to the PowerShell script file to be analyzed.
    .PARAMETER CodeBlock
        A string containing the PowerShell code block to be analyzed.
    .EXAMPLE
        Get-CyclomaticComplexity -FilePath "C:\Scripts\MyScript.ps1"
    .EXAMPLE
        $code = @"
        if ($true) { Write-Output "True" }
        else { Write-Output "False" }
        function Test {
            if ($true) { Write-Output "True" }
            else { Write-Output "False" }
        }
